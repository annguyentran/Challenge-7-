# README.md Generator

This is a README.md generator that uses node.js to generate sample README.md for the user. The user will be asked a series of prompts and the user's answers should be
displayed when the README is generatored. There is a table of contents with a license badge at the top of the README.md. At the bottom of the README.md should be
the license description.
